Curating DJ lineups, conceptualizing fashion and accessory collaborations, and creating the iconic Cakeshop posters, are only a few things XL is responsible for. A very well rounded DJ in his own right, XL has played alongside many Cakeshop guests and is a staple behind the decks at rooftop jams that scatter across Seoul's horizon in the summer. Visual artist, musician, remixer, curator, and the list continues. One third of the elusive Extreme Dream Crew, and loved by crews worldwide, XL is always supplying heat."}
